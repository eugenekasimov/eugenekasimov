          I spent several years working on Shopify's Flagship Themes team, contributing to Dawn (top-5 contributor) and helping build Horizon from scratch.

        <p>
          Working inside Shopify gave me a deep understanding of modern theme architecture, Online Store 2.0, performance optimization, and how real merchants actually use their storefronts.

        <p>
          Today, I work directly with brands who want more than quick fixes. I help merchants improve performance, clean up technical debt, and build storefronts that are scalable, fast, and conversion-focused.
