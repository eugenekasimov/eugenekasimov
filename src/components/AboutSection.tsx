              I spent several years working on Shopify's Flagship Themes team,
              contributing to Dawn (top-5 contributor) and helping build Horizon
              from scratch. The code I shipped there now powers millions of
              online stores worldwide.

              Working inside Shopify gave me a deep understanding of modern
              theme architecture, Online Store 2.0, performance optimization,
              accessibility (including WCAG compliance), and how real merchants
              actually use their storefronts.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, I work directly with brands who want more than quick fixes.
              I bring the same production-grade standards to every merchant
              project — architected Liquid, clean and maintainable code, fast
              load times, and minimal technical debt.
            </p>
            <p>Based in Alberta, I work with Shopify brands globally.</p>
